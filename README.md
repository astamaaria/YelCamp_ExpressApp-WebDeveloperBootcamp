YelCamp_ExpressApp-WebDeveloperBootcamp
YelpCamp is simple ExpressApp about fictional camping sites with signup, comments and individual camppages. Users can create, edit and remove their own campgrounds and leave comments to others' campgrounds. The core functionalities are done, but some details need work. If you want to check the site out, it is running in <a href="https://boiling-headland-29006.herokuapp.com/"> Heroku</a>. I'm utilizing CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, JS, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Mongoose and Passport in this project.
This project was also created on Colt Steele's<a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/"> Web Developer Bootcamp </a>online course.
